"""Watched download folders: which videos are there, and which have really finished downloading.

A file counts as finished only when it looked the same (size and time) at two looks in a row,
nothing has written to it for QUIET_S, and it can be opened with nobody else holding it. Change
notifications are not used: over SMB (the NAS) Windows misses them, so a look every few minutes is
the base. Temporary download names, samples and the NAS's own folders are never candidates.
